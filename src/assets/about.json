  "title": "About the project",
  "description": "\"Keeper\" is a project inspired by Google Keep, designed to allow users to make quick notes and capture their ideas effortlessly. This project was completely focused on the React library and was part of the curriculum in The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. However, I expanded upon the original lessons by adding my own features, such as styling with Tailwind CSS, as well as numerous UI and UX improvements. The goal was to create a more dynamic and visually appealing user experience while maintaining a focus on simplicity and efficiency.",

  "secondDescription": "This version of the \"Keeper\" app is designed as a demo for my portfolio and focuses on demonstrating UI/UX design and React-based frontend capabilities. While authentication and database integration are crucial for a fully functional notes app, I chose not to implement them here as I've already covered similar backend functionality in other projects."
